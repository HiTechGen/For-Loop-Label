# For-Loop-Label
I introduce my late idea but you won't regret knowing it in the first place.  If you're struggling to find another method that does the same operation as command "goto" then i have it and it provides multiple features such as.  Features: 1] It continues to run command inside the parenthesis even if the label already change. 2] You can customize wether activate the feature in no. 1 3] It gives a better performance and speed than using command "goto". 4] You can customize the command "for /l" wether use count or loop.
